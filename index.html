    <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> Brains and Bytes: How Technology Helps Us Understand the Mind</h1>
    <p><b>IBRO/Dana Brain Awareness Week Grant Proposal 2026</b></p>
    <p>Connecting neuroscience, technology, and education through interactive learning</p>
</header>

<section>
    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb icon"></i> About the Project</h2>
    <p><b>Brains and Bytes</b> is a science outreach project created to introduce high school and university students to the connection between the brain and technology. The goal is to show, in a simple and fun way, how computers and engineering tools can help us study how the brain works.</p>
    <p>Through short talks, interactive activities, and live demonstrations with EEG, students will see how brain signals can be recorded and turned into digital information. The event will encourage curiosity about how the mind works and demonstrate how neuroscience and computer science can collaborate to generate innovation.</p>

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-users icon"></i> Target Audience and Community Impact</h2>
    <p>The main audience will be high school and university students from the local community around Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara. Many are curious about science and technology but have not had direct exposure to how neuroscience connects with engineering and computing.</p>
    <p>The event will also be open to the general public interested in learning more about the brain and technology, helping to strengthen scientific culture and inspire curiosity about neuroscience and innovation.</p>

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-microscope icon"></i> Neuroscience Connection & Brain Awareness</h2>
    <p>This project directly supports the IBRO–Dana Brain Awareness Week Grants by promoting understanding of neuroscience among the public. Participants will see how neural activity can be measured using EEG and interpreted through computational tools.</p>
    <p>By linking brain science with everyday technology, participants will learn that neuroscience extends beyond medical fields into real-world applications, making science accessible and engaging.</p>

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-calendar-days icon"></i> Three-Day Program (March 18–20, 2026)</h2>

    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-eye icon"></i> Visibility, Diversity & Inclusion, and Alignment with IBRO/Dana Goals</h2>
    <p><b>Visibility:</b> The IBRO and Dana Foundation logos will be prominently displayed on all printed and digital materials, including posters, flyers, social media posts, and handouts. They will also appear in presentations during talks and workshops. The event website and promotional posts will clearly acknowledge IBRO and Dana as the funding organizations, ensuring maximum visibility before, during, and after the event.</p>
    <p><b>Diversity & Inclusion:</b> The event will ensure balanced gender representation among speakers and panelists. Participation will be open to students from various schools and universities in the local community and beyond, promoting geographical diversity and including audiences that historically have had limited exposure to neuroscience.</p>
    <p><b>Alignment with IBRO/Dana Goals:</b> This project directly supports IBRO and Dana’s mission by increasing public awareness of neuroscience, inspiring young people to explore brain science, and demonstrating how neuroscience connects with technology and education in accessible, hands-on ways.</p>
